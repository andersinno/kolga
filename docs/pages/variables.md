# Variables

## Overview

An environment variable is a dynamic-named value that can affect the way running processes will
behave on an operating system.

Variables are useful for customizing the CI/CD pipeline as it makes the pipeline more
flexible and easier to configure. It also means less hardcoded values.

## Predefined variables

The DevOps pipeline is build to be able to run existing CI/CD platforms such as GitLab CI,
Travis and CircleCI. It utilizes the variables exposed by those platforms and unifies
them into a set of predefined variables in the DevOps pipeline.

For instance, GitLab exposes a variables named `CI_COMMIT_SHA`. While the name does not
contain anything pointing to GitLab itself, it is uncertain if this variable name is used
on other platforms, for that reason we add a variable `GIT_COMMIT_SHA` which always will
point to the SHA of a commit, no matter the underlying platform, as long as the platform
supplies a predefined variables with the SHA.

## Command variables

Certain variables reflect commands that will be run at certain stages of the applications
life-cycle. Such variables can for instance be used to run a command before the application
starts to do database migrations.

| Variable               | Description                    | Default | CI Support |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------- | ---------- |
| APP_INITIALIZE_COMMAND | Command to run on first start  |         |            |
| APP_MIGRATE_COMMAND    | Command to run on every update |         |            |
